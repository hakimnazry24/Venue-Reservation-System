Brief Description for Case Study
```
Our case study is on the Venue Reservation System. Users have 30 venues to choose from from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m.
The user can book for a minimum 2 hours and a maximum 2 hours for each venue. The user can modify, delete, and view
his reservation. It is based on a first-come, first-served basis. Lastly, the admin can add, modify, and
view details of the reservations made by users.
